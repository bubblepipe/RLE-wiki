# 引言

<!--
Hey, friend. Want to change your voice? Well... you can - that's an option.

Your voice is much more malleable than you may realize. There are at least a dozen different dimensions that you can learn to control independently to change the sound of your voice. The way you talk right now is not your one "true" voice, it is a habit. A habit that can be changed, if you so choose.

I like to come at this challenge from two angles. One is to break down all the muscle movements involved and learn to manipulate them individually, through simple drills. The other is to listen to carefully selected example voices and learn to imitate them, intuitively. You will get results much faster by using both, as you do in this guide.

嘿，朋友。想要改变你的声音吗？这完全是可能的！

声音的可塑性往往超乎想象。声音的表现方式至少被十几个独立的因素所决定，而每一个都可以被独立控制。我们日常的说话方式，并不是“唯一真实”声音，而只是一个习惯。而习惯是可以改变的，只要愿意。

本指南会从两个方面着手这个问题。首先，我们可以分解所有涉及到发声的肌肉运动，并通过简单的练习学会单独操控它们；另外，我们可以尝试模仿一些精心准备的声音示例，并尝试自然地发出同样的声音。如果你能同时运用这两种方法，就会获得更快的成果。

My approach to voice training is not a process of feminization. It is a journey in flexibility, to full fluency over the entire possibility space of your voice. This guide is aimed at those of you who are already comfortable in the masculine end of the spectrum. With the exercises I've gathered here, you will familiarize yourself with the feminine end - and everything in between.

Once you have gained complete freedom across your vocal range, you can choose exactly where you'd like to live - whether that is within one voice, or two. Or three. Masculine, feminine, or androgynous, young or old, human or cartoon. Any or all. It's up to you.

So now, listen to this clip to hear me demonstrate the eight most important elements for vocal feminization, gradually transforming a masculine voice into a feminine one. Then, listen to this clip to hear how they sound one at a time, in isolation. With practice, you can learn to do this too!

尽管本指南专为那些已经习惯在低声域发声的人准备，但是这些声音训练不仅仅是单纯的女性化过程，更是一次旅程——通往自由发声的可能性。

在完全掌控了自己的声音之后，我们就可以自由地选择发出男性化、女性化、中性、年轻、年老，二次元角色的声音，甚至是多种声音之间的灵活切换。

现在，请听[这段音频](https://clyp.it/5eq3io3u)，我会逐步展示八个最重要的发声要素，慢慢将男音转变为女音。然后，再听[这段音频](https://clyp.it/ggetrab2)，了解每个要素单独呈现时的效果。
通过练习，你也能做到！

Most of the material in this guide can be traced back to the pioneering work of Zheanna Erose of TransVoiceLessons, as well as the excellent free tutorial videos at New York Vocal Coaching. Many thanks, also, to the Scinguistics community, and of course, all of you lovely people here on r/transvoice!

I've organized this guide into four levels, from Foundations to Mastery, each split into three subsections. You could easily spend a month on each level - a week or two per subsection. But you don't have to master each subsection before moving on to the next. Just give yourself enough time to digest the material and get a feel for it, and then start the next subsection as soon as you no longer feel overwhelmed.

Ready? Let's begin.

本指南的许多内容都可以追溯到 Zheanna Erose 的先驱性探索（TransVoiceLessons），以及 New York Vocal Coaching 提供的优质免费视频。同时，我也要感谢 Scinguistics 社区，以及在 r/transvoice 论坛的所有朋友们！

我已将本指南分为四个阶段，从基础到精通，每个阶段又分为三个章节，如上目录所示。每个阶段的用时估计是大约一个月时间，每个章节大约一到两周。不过，并不需要彻底掌握一个章节的内容后才能开始下一个章节。请给自己足够的时间消化内容，熟悉并掌握发声的感觉，在确保不过度疲劳的前提下继续学习。


准备好了吗？让我们开始吧！

# 第一阶段 - 基础 

<!--
1. Inspiration
-->
## 1.1 灵感

<!--
Start by watching this video for a really quick overview of the voice feminization process (and optionally, this video to learn more about the acoustic theory involved). Then watch this video for a breakdown of the vocal anatomy involved.

Your homework is to find a recording of a female speaking voice that you'd like to be able to imitate, that can serve as an inspiration and a point of reference. It doesn't have to be the one perfect, ultimate voice - just find one or two examples that seem pleasant and relatable. Think of female actresses or characters with nice voices, or YouTubers or podcast hosts you enjoy (search for "female youtubers" or "female podcast hosts" if you need some ideas). Mine is this podcast interview with Keon Saghari. Go ahead and use that if you can't decide on one right now!

Then start listening to it, at least a little bit every day. This will help you internalize the sounds and speech patterns of the voice that you like. And be on the lookout for new voices - if you find one you like better, start listening to that one instead!
-->

首先，观看[这段视频](https://youtu.be/dZKzuVfUv3E)，以了解声音女性化训练的整体流程（也可以看看[这个](https://youtu.be/ynFqjE2AEGk)）。然后，观看[这段视频](https://youtu.be/xVAVi11kzbM?t=133)，了解发声相关的解剖学概念。

作业：找到一段女性讲话录音，作为参考和灵感来源。
它不必绝对理想或完美，只需听起来悦耳、与你相契合即可。
可以考虑有好听声音的女性演员或角色，或者是你喜欢的女性 YouTuber、博客主持人（如果没有想法，可以搜索“女性 YouTuber”或“女性播客主持”）
我选的是[ Keon Saghari 在一档播客节目中的采访](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pIUvhv59np_tDRK7w0s75IQ3ByIoG6bs)，如果你暂时选不出来，可以先用这个！

然后，每天至少听一小段录音。这会帮助你内化喜欢的声音和语音模式。同时，也可以不断寻找新声音 —— 如果找到更喜欢的，就切换到新的参考录音！

2. Vocal Tract Length
-->
## 1.2 声道长度

<!--
Next you want to start strengthening and learning to control the muscles that raise your larynx (or voice box). This is how you shorten the length of your vocal tract, from your larynx to your lips, to match the proportions of a typical female vocal tract. Building these muscles will take a while, so we'll start with this first.

Do not do the swallow-and-hold exercise from this video, as the hold can cause unnecessary strain, but do try swallowing a few times. You want to touch your larynx (Adam's apple) lightly with your finger, and then yawn and feel it move down, and then swallow and feel it move up.

Once you have felt this a few times, watch this video and try the "big dog, small dog" exercise. If you're having trouble with the small dog, it can help to start yawning, to bring the larynx down, and then start to swallow to bring the larynx up, and then stick your tongue out like a dog panting and say "ahh" in a whisper to make sure you're not closing off your throat. Then watch this video and try the whisper siren exercise. You want to smoothly slide from a big dog "uhh" to a small dog "ehh" as your larynx slides upward. Again, place a finger or two lightly on your throat to feel your larynx move up and down.

Your homework is to practice the whisper siren for few minutes whenever you remember, throughout the day - say, whenever you go to the bathroom. It's almost silent, so you can do it anywhere and practice holding your muscles in place at the top (the high end of the siren, or the small dog) to build strength. Eventually, you want to learn to lift your larynx easily, without straining the muscles in your jaw and neck. As you get more comfortable with it, try to relax your neck a little bit more each time, until you can do it without tension. -->

接下来，我们要锻炼并学会控制抬高喉结的肌肉。这样就可以缩短声道从喉结到嘴唇区间的长度，使其长度更接近女性的典型声道。训练这些肌肉需要时间，我们会从如下的方法开始：

请不要[做这个视频](https://youtu.be/aWWevU4A5mU)中的吞咽后保持喉结上升的练习，因为这可能会导致肌肉的过度拉伸，造成疼痛和不适，但可以尝试简单地吞咽几次。同时，用手轻触喉结，可以感受到：打哈欠会使得喉结向下移动，吞咽会使得喉结向上移动。

在这之后，尝试[这段视频](https://youtu.be/mx4dPWKVt9o)里的“大狗、小狗”练习。
如果感觉“小狗”声音很难发出来，可以先打哈欠，让喉结下移，然后吞咽，让喉头上移，再伸出舌头模仿小狗喘气，然后轻声发出“哈啊”，期间确保喉咙敞开。然后观看[这段视频](https://youtu.be/F6Noi2qERus)，尝试“静悄悄的汽笛”练习。在从“大狗”声音慢慢过渡到“小狗”声音的同时，感受喉结的的上升。同样，可以用手轻触喉结，以确认喉结的移动。


作业：
每天利用空闲时间练习几分钟的“静悄悄的汽笛”，比如在洗澡的时候。这个练习几乎是无声的，所以可以在任何地方进行，并在最高音（类似“小狗”的声音）时保持喉部肌肉稳定，以增强肌肉力量。这个练习的目的是学会轻松抬起喉结，同时下颚和颈部的肌肉不用过度发力。随着练习的深入，逐渐尝试放松颈部，直到可以毫不费力地完成这个练习。

3. Pitch
-->

## 1.3 音高

<!--
Keep doing the previous exercises every day, but when you're ready for something more, you can start working on your pitch, or how high or low your voice is. Pitch is just one of many elements, and not even the most important, but it's probably the most well-known difference between the average male and female voice.

In addition to pitch, there are several registers that your voice will lock into at different points along your range, each with a different sound quality. Watch this video to hear the differences between a chest voice and a falsetto (and a mix voice, which is technically the same register as your chest voice, your modal register). Follow along with the warmups in this video, and then try switching between the registers a few times, both singing and speaking.

Then download the Android app Vocal Pitch Monitor (or Vocal Pitch Monitor on iOS) and in the settings, change the Scale to D Major and check the box to Display frequency in Hz. With the app running, talk in your starting voice and see where your pitch falls, naturally. A typical male speaking voice will stay between D2 and D3 (which are marked by horizontal lines, since we set the Scale to D Major). Now try talking higher and higher in pitch, until your voice is in the female range, around D3 (150 Hz) and above. Don't go higher than D4 (300 Hz), though, or you'll sound like a cartoon character!

You might find that you start in your modal register when you're in the male range, but flip over into falsetto at some point in order to get into the female range. Or you might find that you have to strain and shout to get that high. If that happens, just go back down to the pitch where you can still speak comfortably in your modal register and don't worry about going higher for now.

Your homework is to set aside some time every day (say, half an hour) to warm up with the video above and then practice speaking in the female range (between D3 and D4, or 150-300 Hz) or as close as you can get without straining or going into a falsetto. You can just say random things that pop into your head, recite lines from memory, or read a book or reddit comments out loud, while keeping an eye on your pitch in Vocal Pitch Monitor.

It might sound terrible, but that's okay - the important thing is to get used to speaking in that range. Drink water throughout and take a break if you feel your voice getting strained or hoarse.

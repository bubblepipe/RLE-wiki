# 2.1 共鸣（困难）  

<!--
Once you are comfortable with manipulating your larynx and your pitch, and you'd like an additional challenge, you can try doing them at the same time. That means, while you are trying to talk in the female range, you also raise your larynx to reduce your vocal tract length. Start by following along with the exercises in this video.

It will probably sound pretty bad at first, but that's fine! Your goal at this stage is not to sound feminine, but to keep your pitch between D3 and D4 (150-300 Hz) and keep your larynx raised while talking (which you can feel by holding a finger lightly to your throat).

Your voice should sound more buzzy and brassy, which you'd call a bright resonance (or bright timbre), as opposed to the dark, hollow resonance of more masculine voices - and that's a good thing! Watch this video to hear a great demonstration of this effect - you want your voice to be in the upper-right quadrant of the diagram.

在可以熟练控制喉结位置和音高后，可以开始尝试同时提高喉结和音高：在尝试用女性音域说话的同时，提高喉结以缩短声道长度。建议先跟随[此视频](https://youtu.be/iTViDd0QPEI)中的练习开始训练。

初期声音可能会显得生硬刺耳，这完全正常！现阶段的目标不是追求完美的女声，而是将音高维持在D3到D4之间（150-300赫兹），并在说话时保持喉结上提（用手指轻触喉结以确认）。此时声音会呈现更明亮的"金属感"共鸣，不同于男声低沉、空洞的共鸣 —— 这正是我们想要的！通过[此视频](https://youtu.be/21ZfGPp-Ves)可以直观感受这种效果，目标是将声音调整到示意图的右上方。

Then, on top of that, you want to learn to arch your tongue up and push it forward to reduce the amount of space in your mouth where sound can resonate. To get the feeling, whisper "kee" (as in "key") and keep pushing the middle of your tongue up high for the "ee" - just below where it touches the roof of your mouth to make the "k" sound. Say it a few times, while keeping your tongue clenched, pushing it a little higher each time. This is the smallest space you can make inside your mouth, the bright extreme of your oral resonance, opposite a yawn.

That's great for saying an "ee" sound, but when feminizing the other vowels, your tongue will be lower than it is for the "ee" but still higher and more forward than it would be in your masculine voice. And you still want to feel a bit of tension in your tongue, that clench, throughout. Essentially, you want to talk with a small space at the front of your mouth. That makes it sound like you have a smaller mouth than you actually do, which makes you sound more feminine.

Gaining mastery over your tongue is one of the trickiest skills of voice feminization, but it's arguably one of the most important. Get started on it by practicing the exercises in this video. Then watch this video and try some sirens and trills across your range while raising your larynx and tongue.

在此基础上，我们需要将舌头拱起并前推，减少口腔共鸣空间。为了找到这种感觉，可以轻声发出"kee"（"key"的发音），并在发"ee"音时保持舌中段上抬，略低于发"k"音时触碰上颚的位置。多次重复练习，逐步加强舌部肌肉的紧绷感，这就是最小口腔共鸣空间，代表着口腔共鸣的"最明亮"极限，与打哈欠时的状态完全相反。

在试图通过女声发出其他元音时，舌位虽比"ee"音稍低，但仍需比男性发声时更高更前移。整个过程中需保持舌部适度的紧绷感。舌头训练的本质上就是通过缩小口腔前部空间以“缩小嘴巴”，从而增强声音的女性特质。

舌部控制是声音女性化训练中最具挑战性的环节之一，却也可能是最为关键的技术。建议跟着[这个视频](https://youtu.be/yFot-l2iVHw)进行专项练习，再配合[此视频](https://web.archive.org/web/20200321191952id_/https://r3---sn-n4v7knl6.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1584839985&ei=0Wh2XuSxINKRkwbR-57gDw&ip=207.241.231.174&id=o-AJ2vUafZ5cvQMSRctQhBdx7uRwDMacXX4n6ybMQCzGcq&itag=18&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&mh=TB&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-n4v7knl6%2Csn-a5mekn7r&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=2&pl=20&initcwndbps=4528750&vprv=1&mime=video%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=33578688&ratebypass=yes&dur=750.190&lmt=1471833091508857&mt=1584818254&fvip=3&c=WEB&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cratebypass%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=ADKhkGMwRAIgJX3PLOf8KyyLDYEmw4hTsdPP2iBsp-I-vzAbnBvyMZsCIHBKe5A_0AujHzZR0zgtwGZc_q2DFrA_vD7W2JDiqBFJ&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ABSNjpQwRAIgDsql_8uDbpP9xDY2HwGgc-QtHDY8Sg_PAK-BpcIKS_oCIDD_1XsV7XJu8ALOoxL-3WQXO_LWyaMxcgOGRi0oD0Y5&video_id=biZN6zcBpVo)中的滑音与颤音训练，在提升喉结高度的同时进行舌部控制。

<!--
Your homework is to take your daily speaking practice, where you try to keep your pitch between D3 and D4, and spend at least half that time talking with your larynx raised as well, for a bright, buzzy sound. Then, as best you can, try to add in the tongue clench too, pushing it up and forward to brighten the sound even more. See how it sounds with your larynx raised or lowered, your tongue arched or relaxed, and your pitch high or low, as well as in a whisper.

This is likely to cause a lot of tension in the muscles of your neck and throat at first, so do trills and yawn every so often to help them relax again. You can even try lying on your back while practicing, to force your body to relax. And of course, sip water throughout your practice session and take a break when your voice gets too tired or hoarse.

Also, keep practicing your whisper sirens multiple times a day, but add a whispered "kee" at the end of each one to bring your tongue up. This will allow you to go even higher with the siren and make a really tiny dog sound! Again, hold those muscles in place at the top and really clench your tongue. At the same time, try to relax as much tension as you can in your jaw and neck while still holding the same shape.

作业：在进行音高训练（保持D3-D4音域）时，至少用一半时间同步练习喉结上提，发出明亮的音色。随后，尝试加上舌部上拱前推的动作，进一步提亮音色。可以尝试不同的排列组合：喉结高低/舌头松紧/音高升降/气声强弱，观察声音变化。

一开始可能导致颈喉肌肉过度紧张，可以通过通过颤音、打哈欠、甚至是躺平来放松。注意补充水分，当声音出现沙哑疲劳时应休息。

保持每日多次的“静悄悄的汽笛”练习，每次末端加入小声的"kee"音以上抬舌头。这将帮助你突破音高极限，发出更像“小狗”的超高音！同样，在音高顶点时需保持舌部肌肉持续发力，同时注意放松下巴与颈部肌肉。

# 2.2 开放系数

<!--
Go ahead and breathe a sigh of relief, because it's time for something a little easier!

Feminine voices generally sound softer and more breathy than masculine voices. Marilyn Monroe is an iconic example of this, as you can hear in this video.

When you try to speak in the upper range of your modal register without going into a falsetto, the natural tendency is to strain to reach those higher notes, which makes your voice sound harder, not softer, and not particularly feminine. This is because you put a lot of compression on your vocal folds (vocal cords), squeezing them together more tightly. You want to learn to use less compression for a softer sound, where your vocal folds stay open more (open quotient) while vibrating. With high compression (closed quotient), adding breathiness will just result in a strained sound like Ash Ketchum from Pokemon, as in this video.

现在可以松一口气了，因为这一章节要做的事情会轻松一些！

女性化的声音通常比男性化的声音更柔和、更富有气息感。玛丽莲梦露就是这种声音的经典代表，你可以在[这个视频](https://youtu.be/ikUjhv4iT58)中听到她的声音。

当尝试用本嗓的高音范围内发声，而不进入假声时，可能会发现自己不自觉地用力去达到那些较高的音高。这样做的结果是声音会变得更加紧张，而不是更加柔和或女性化。这是因为发声时声带受力压缩，使它们更加紧密地贴合在一起。你需要学会减少这种压缩，以获得一种更柔和的声音，让你的声带在振动时保持更开放的状态（更高的开放系数）。被压缩的声带（高闭合系数）再气息，会使得声音听起来像[《宝可梦》中的小智](https://youtu.be/s-0DuYcWeBE)（Ash Ketchum）。

<!--
To learn to control the compression in your voice, start by watching this video and trying the "ah-ha" exercise and the vowel slides. Then download the Android app Spectroid (or Spectrogram Pro on iOS), and in the audio settings, change the Desired transform interval to 10 ms (100 Hz) and check the box to Stay awake in the display settings.

With the app running, start by saying "ahh" for a few seconds in your normal speaking voice. In the scrolling display, you should see a bunch of bright yellow lines showing up against the purple and pink background noise. Then whisper "ahh" for a few seconds, just with your breath. You should see some faint pink smudges, but no yellow lines. Now, heave a big, breathy sigh while saying "ahh..." in a soft, relaxed voice. Ideally, you will see faint yellow lines melding into a background of pink smudges. This is what it looks like when your voice has a high open quotient. It's somewhere in between a normal voice and a whisper.

为了学习声带压缩的控制，可以跟着[这个视频](https://youtu.be/J9K74QEzntA?t=240)练习其中的“啊-哈”练习和元音滑音练习。然后下载 Android 版的 [Spectroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.intoorbit.spectrum&hl=en_US) 应用（iOS 可以下载 [Spectrogram Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spectrogram-pro-with-super-smooth-60hz-update/id415301721)）。进入应用的音频设置，将 *Desired transform interval* 设置为 10 毫秒（100 Hz），然后在显示设置中勾选*Stay awake*选项。

打开应用后，先用正常的说话声音发“啊”几秒钟。在屏幕上应该会看到许多明亮的黄色线条出现在紫色和粉色的背景噪声上。然后试着用耳语的方式发“啊”几秒钟，仅仅用气息发声。这时应该只有一些微弱的粉色模糊痕迹，而没有黄色线条。接着，做一个深长、富有气息感的叹息，同时轻柔地说“啊……”。理想情况下，会有一些微弱的黄色线条，与背景的粉色模糊痕迹融合在一起。这就是声音在高开放系数状态下的样子，它介于正常发声和耳语之间。

<!--
Your homework is to spend a few minutes before your other voice exercises, to slide between a whisper and your normal speaking voice. It's a good warmup! You can start with one long, whispered "ahh" that you gradually turn into a spoken "ahh" and then back to a whisper, just by changing the compression. Do this with the Spectroid app running, so you can see the change as well as hear it. For a bit more of a challenge, try smoothly changing from a whisper, to a soft voice, to a normal voice while speaking or reading out loud.

Of course, you can also play with this during your daily speaking practice. See if you can make your voice a little softer, or really breathy, or changing from one extreme to another while still maintaining the feminine aspects of pitch and resonance that you've been working on.

作业：在进行其他声音训练之前，花几分钟的时间在耳语和正常说话声音之间滑动调整。这是一个很好的热身练习！可以先发出一个长长的耳语“啊”，然后逐渐过渡到正常发声的“啊”，再慢慢回到耳语，仅仅通过改变压缩程度来实现。在进行这个练习时，让 Spectroid 应用保持运行，这样不仅可以听到声音的变化，还可以在屏幕上看到它的变化。如果想要挑战自己，可以尝试在耳语、轻柔的声音和正常声音之间平滑过渡，同时朗读文章或说话。

当然，你也可以在日常的说话练习中玩转这个技巧。看看你是否能让自己的声音变得更柔和，或者更加富有气息，甚至从一个极端变化到另一个极端，同时保持你一直在练习的女性化音高和共鸣特征。
